# My Life in Weeks

Hey, [Jeremy](https://jeremyrobertjones.com/) here. Each box on this grid represents one week of my life. It is interspersed with events and situations. (Although as I filled this out, I began to feel a bit squeamish about adding a bunch of personal stuff. So for now, this is an odd mixture of pivotal world events and places where Iâ€™ve lived and worked. ðŸ¤·)

This is based on [a 2014 post by Tim Urban at Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html), [Buster Bensonâ€™s interactive version](https://busterbenson.com/life-in-weeks), and, more recently, [Gina Trapaniâ€™s implementation](https://weeks.ginatrapani.org/). I do love a combination data visualization / mortality reminder, so I decided to make my own.
